/* For joystick */

After the command "rosrun joy joy_node", if you get the error:

"[ERROR] [1580579912.157133017]: Couldn't open joystick force feedback!
[ INFO] [1580579912.158771272]: Opened joystick: /dev/input/js0. deadzone_: 0.050000. "

just ignore it. It doesn't matter and does not cause any issues.
